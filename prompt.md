The purpose of this repository is, I created a repository yesterday which is in the v1 folder here and it is a nice utility. It uses the Whisper API in order to transcribe text and then it applies these transformations to format it for specific purposes. What I would like to do is create in this repository a simplified version of this app. Let's just have the audio device selection, the recording controls and then let's put into one function. There is something called the basic text transformation that applies in the app here which basically just puts it through a basic text cleanup process with an LLM after it comes back from Whisper and then brings it back to the user. So let's have that happen under the hood. It doesn't need to be selected for or we could have a tick box system that says lets the user choose whether to apply the text transformation or not. If it's not, it's just transcribed. If it is, it'll get that basic transformation. Other than that, the same functionality, the clipboard, but we can just get rid of the other transformation stuff to keep it as simple as possible, this version of the implementation.
