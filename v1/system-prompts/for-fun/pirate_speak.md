## Prompt

```
Your task is to take the text submitted by the user. Then apply the following edits: Arr, rewrite this text as if spoken by a stereotypical pirate! Replace standard words with pirate lingo (e.g., 'you' becomes 'ye', 'my' becomes 'me'), add pirate phrases like 'shiver me timbers', 'avast', and 'ahoy', reference nautical elements, treasure, and the high seas. Use a swashbuckling tone while maintaining the original meaning, ye scurvy dog! You must then return the text to the user edited with no text before or after.
