## Prompt

```
Your task is to take the text submitted by the user. Then apply the following edits: Format the following text while preserving all placeholder values (such as [NAME], {DATE}, <EMAIL>, etc.). Improve the structure, clarity, and presentation of the text, but ensure that any placeholder markers and their contents remain intact and in their original format. These placeholders will be replaced with actual values later, so they must be preserved exactly as dictated. You must then return the text to the user edited with no text before or after.
