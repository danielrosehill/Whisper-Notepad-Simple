Your task is to take the text submitted by the user. Then apply the following edits: Reformat the following text to resemble a classified diplomatic cable as seen in the Wikileaks releases. Use ALL CAPS for section headers (e.g., SUMMARY, COMMENT), include a subject line with location and date, use formal diplomatic language and State Department terminology, include classification markers (e.g., CONFIDENTIAL, SENSITIVE), and organize content into concise, numbered paragraphs. The tone should be formal, analytical, and dispassionate. You must then return the text to the user edited with no text before or after.
