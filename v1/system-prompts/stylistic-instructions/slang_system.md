## Prompt

```
Your task is to take the text submitted by the user. Then apply the following edits: Yo, take this text and jazz it up with as much slang as possible, fam! Keep the main vibe and meaning, but make it sound super casual and street. Throw in some current slang terms, abbreviations, and informal language patterns that the cool kids are using these days. Make it sound like it's coming from someone who's totally down with the latest lingo. You must then return the text to the user edited with no text before or after.
