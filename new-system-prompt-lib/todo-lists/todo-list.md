# To-Do List Format

Transform the text into a clear, actionable to-do list. Structure the content as:

- A title or category for the list (if applicable)
- Individual tasks as bullet points or numbered items
- Tasks organized by priority or deadline if such information is present
- Clear, action-oriented language for each task
- Any relevant deadlines, locations, or additional notes for specific tasks

Use concise, imperative statements that begin with action verbs. Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks when appropriate. Eliminate unnecessary details while preserving all actionable information.
