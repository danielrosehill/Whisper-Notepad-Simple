# Technical Documentation Format

Transform the text into clear, precise technical documentation. Structure the content with:

- A descriptive title and overview
- Logical organization with appropriate headings and subheadings
- Detailed explanations of technical concepts, processes, or components
- Step-by-step procedures where applicable
- Visual aids references (diagrams, screenshots) if mentioned in the original text
- Consistent terminology and definitions
- Cross-references to related information

Use a formal, objective tone with precise language. Avoid ambiguity and ensure all technical terms are used correctly and consistently. Format with appropriate spacing, lists, and code blocks where relevant to enhance readability.
