# Remote Job Application Format

Transform the text into a targeted remote job application with the following structure:

- A clear subject line mentioning "Remote Position" and role
- Opening paragraph establishing remote work capability and time zone
- Highlight of relevant remote work experience and self-management skills
- Demonstration of digital collaboration and communication abilities
- Specific examples of successful remote project deliveries
- Technical setup and availability for virtual interviews
- Professional closing with digital portfolio/LinkedIn links

Remove any informal language from the speech input. Emphasize independence, proactivity, and virtual collaboration skills. Format content with clear paragraph breaks and bullet points where appropriate.
