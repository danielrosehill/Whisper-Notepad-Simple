# Specific Job Application Format

Transform the text into a targeted job application letter with the following structure:

- Reference to the specific job posting and where it was found
- Opening paragraph showing clear connection to role requirements
- Evidence of research about the company and its values
- Direct mapping of your experience to job requirements
- Specific achievements relevant to the position
- Enthusiasm for the role and company culture
- Professional closing with follow-up intention

Convert casual speech into formal business language. Remove filler words and repetitive phrases. Structure content to directly address job requirements. Use bullet points for experience mapping where appropriate. Maintain professional tone throughout.
