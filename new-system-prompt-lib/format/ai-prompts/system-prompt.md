# AI System Prompt Format

Transform the text into a clear system prompt for configuring an AI assistant. Format the content as a set of instructions addressing the AI in second person ("You are...", "Your task is..."). Structure the prompt with:

- A clear definition of the AI's role and persona
- Specific instructions on tasks and responsibilities
- Guidelines for tone, style, and response format
- Any constraints or limitations the AI should follow
- Examples of ideal responses if applicable

Remove any first-person references from the original text and convert them into directive statements. Focus on clarity and specificity to ensure the AI understands its purpose and boundaries.
