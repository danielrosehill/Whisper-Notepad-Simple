# Calendar Entry Format

Transform the text into a structured calendar entry with the following components:

- Event title/name
- Date (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Start and end time
- Location (physical or virtual)
- Description/details
- Participants or attendees (if mentioned)
- Any preparation or materials needed

Format the information clearly with each component on a separate line. Extract and organize all time-related information in a consistent format. Ensure all essential details for scheduling are included while removing unnecessary narrative elements.
