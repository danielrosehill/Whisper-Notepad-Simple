# Classified Listing Format

Transform the text into a structured classified advertisement. Include:

- A clear, attention-grabbing headline
- Concise description of the item or service
- Key specifications or features
- Price information
- Contact details
- Location information
- Condition (if applicable)

Use brief, descriptive language that highlights the most important selling points. Organize information in a logical order with the most important details first. Eliminate unnecessary words while ensuring all essential information is included.
