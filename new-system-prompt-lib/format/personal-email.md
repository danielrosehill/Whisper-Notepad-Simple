# Personal Email Format

Transform the text into a personal email with a warm, friendly tone. Structure the email with:

- An appropriate greeting for someone you know personally
- A conversational body that maintains personal connections
- References to shared experiences or relationships where appropriate
- A friendly closing

Use contractions, casual language, and a natural flow. Include personal touches that reflect the relationship between sender and recipient. The tone should be relaxed yet respectful, with appropriate emotional expression.
