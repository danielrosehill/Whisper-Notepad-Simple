# Journalistic Style Format

Transform the text into a journalistic article format with the following elements:

- A clear, attention-grabbing headline
- A concise lead paragraph summarizing the key information (who, what, when, where, why, how)
- Body paragraphs that provide details in descending order of importance (inverted pyramid structure)
- Short, factual sentences with minimal editorializing
- Quotes or attributions where appropriate
- A concise conclusion

Use Associated Press (AP) style conventions where applicable. Maintain objectivity and focus on factual reporting rather than opinion. Use third-person perspective throughout.
