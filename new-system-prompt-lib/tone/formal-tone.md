# Formal Tone

Transform the text to use a highly formal tone suitable for official communications. Use proper grammar and sophisticated vocabulary while avoiding contractions. Maintain a respectful distance, using third-person perspective where appropriate. Structure sentences carefully with proper subordination and coordination. Avoid colloquialisms, slang, and informal expressions entirely.
