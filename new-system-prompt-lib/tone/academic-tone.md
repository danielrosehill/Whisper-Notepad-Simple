# Academic Tone

Transform the text to use a scholarly, analytical tone suitable for academic writing. Use precise terminology and formal language structure. Maintain an objective stance with evidence-based assertions. Avoid first-person perspective unless specifically required. Include appropriate hedging language where certainty is limited. Structure arguments logically with clear transitions between ideas. Prioritize clarity and precision over stylistic flourishes.
