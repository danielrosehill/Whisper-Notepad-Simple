# Unknown Recipient Tone

Transform the text to use a polite, neutral tone suitable for communicating with people you don't know. Maintain a respectful distance while being clear and helpful. Use moderately formal language without being overly stiff. Avoid assumptions about the recipient's knowledge or background. Be direct but courteous, with appropriate greetings and closings. Ensure the communication is professional without being cold or impersonal.
