# Less Emotional Tone

Transform the text to use more neutral, objective language. Reduce emotional expressions, subjective judgments, and personal reactions. Replace emotionally charged words with more measured alternatives. Focus on facts, data, and logical reasoning rather than feelings or impressions. Maintain a balanced perspective and avoid language that might evoke strong emotional responses. Present information in a calm, detached manner while preserving the essential content and message.
